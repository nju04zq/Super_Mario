Super Mario is a great game. I've ever tried to make a C copy of it, but
utimatly failed, because too many infrastructures were needed, and it's really
time consuming. Now with python armed, I plan to try again. However, I'm not
sure how far away I can go, and whether I can copy this great game with python.
I've to go to office during the day, and study knew knowledge at night. So no
much time could be spent on this project. Also this game is full of details.
It's challenging to present them all.

Obviously, making such a copy is absoultely of no bussiness value. But it's a
good chance to strengthen my programming skills, also to prove it to others.
I'll start the job today, hope I can achieve the final goal.

At last, my endless admire to those who created Super Mario 30 years ago. They were
really innovative. Now let's just do it, and bear in mind, the best or nothing.
